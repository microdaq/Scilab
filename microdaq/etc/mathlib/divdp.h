 * @par Description:
 *    The divdp_v function returns the division function of a real floating-point 
 *    argument a by b. The return value is the number resulting from a/b.
 * @par 
 * 	  @param[in] a = Input double dividend
 * 	  @param[in] b = Input double divisor
 * @par 
 * 	  @return Resultant double 
 * 
 *
 * @par Special Cases:
 *  - If | b | < 2.225e-308, then the return value is NaN.
 *
 *
 * @sa 
 *  - divdp_i
 *  - divdp_v
 *
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - The code supports little endian mode.
