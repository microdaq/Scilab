/**
 * @par Description:
 *    The powdp function returns the a power of b function. The return value is 
 *    the number a^b.
 * @par 
 * 	  @param[in] a = Input double Base
 * 	  @param[in] b = Input double Power
 * @par 
 * 	  @return Resultant double 
 * 
 *
 * @par Special Cases:
 *  - If a or b is NaN (Not a Number), the return value may be random.
 *  - If a < 0, and b is not an integer value, then NaN is returned.               
 *  - If a = 0, and b < 0, return value is 0 for Asm, Infinity for C/Inline/Vector.
 *  - If |a| = Inf, b < 0, return value is Inf for Asm, 0 for C/Inline/Vector.

 *  - powdp_i
 *  - powdp_v
 *
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - The code supports little endian mode.
