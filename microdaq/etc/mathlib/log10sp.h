/**
 * @par Description:
 *    The log10sp function returns the logarithm function of a real 
 *    floating-point argument a.  The return value is the base 10 logarithmic 
 *    value of a.
 * @par 
 * 	  @param[in] a = Input float 
 * @par 
 * 	  @return Resultant float 
 * 
 *
 * @par Special Cases:
 *  - If a is Inf, the return value is 38.65221 (Asm) or 308.2547 (C/Inline/Vector).
 *
 *
 * @sa 
 *  - log10sp_i
 *  - log10sp_v
 *
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - The code supports little endian mode.
