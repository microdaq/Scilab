/**
 * 	   The data in the x[] array is endian swapped, meaning that 
 *     the byte-order of the bytes within each half-word of the r[] 
 *     array is reversed. This facilitates moving big-endian data 
 *     to a little-endian system or vice-versa.
 *     When the r pointer is non-NULL, the endian-swap occurs out-of-place, 
 *     similar to a block move. When the r pointer is NULL, the endian-swap 
 *     occurs in-place, allowing the swap to occur without using any 
 *     additional storage.
 * 
 * 			@param src      = Source data, must be double-word aligned.
 * 			@param dst      = Destination data, must be double-word aligned.
 * 			@param n_hwords = Number of 16-bit elements to swap.
 * 
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_blk_eswap16_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized 
 * intrinsic C code without restrictions note that the intrinsic C code 
 * is optimized and restrictions may apply.
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 * 		Input and output arrays do not overlap, except when “dst == NULL” so that
 *      the operation occurs in-place. <BR>
 * 		The input array and output array are double-word aligned. <BR>
 *		nx is a multiple of 8. <BR>
 * 
 * @par Implementation notes:
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR> 
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interruptible. <BR>
