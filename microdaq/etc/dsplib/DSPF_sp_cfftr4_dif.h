/**
 *   This routine implements the DIF (decimation in frequency) complex radix 4
 *   FFT with digit-reversed output and normal order input. The number of points,
 *   ‘n’, must be a power of 4 {4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, ...}. This routine is an in-place
 *   routine in the sense that the output is written over the input. It is not an in-place
 *   routine in the sense that the input is in normal order and the output is in digit-reversed
 *   order. There must be n complex points (2*n values), and 3*n/4 complex coefficients
 *   (3*n/2 values).
 *                                                                           
 *         @param x Pointer to an array holding the input and output floating-point array which contains ‘n’ complex points.
 *         @param w Pointer to an array holding the coefficient floating-point array which contains 3*n/4 complex numbers.
 *         @param n Number of complex points in x.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_sp_cfftr4_dif_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized linear assembly code without
 * restrictions. Note that the linear assembly code is optimized and restrictions may
 * apply.  
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     N needs to be power of 4 <BR>
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interrupt-tolerant but not interruptible. <BR>
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>
