 *      This function computes the expression “y = x1*x2?for the matrices
 *      x1 and x2. The columnar dimension of x1 must match the row dimension 
 *      of x2. The resulting matrix has the same number of rows as x1 and the
 *      same number of columns as x2. Each element of Matrices are assumed to 
 *      be complex numbers with real values are stored in even word positions
 *      and imaginary values in odd positions.
 *
 *      @param x1[2*r1*c1]  Input matrix containing r1*c1 complex floating-point numbers 
 *      @param r1           Number of rows in matrix x1. 
 *      @param c1           Number of columns in matrix x1. Also number of rows in matrix x2. 
 *      @param x2[2*c1*c2]  Input matrix containing c1*c2 complex floating-point 
 *      @param c2           Number of columns in matrix x2. 
 *      @param y[2*r1*c2]   Output matrix of c1*c2 complex floating-point numbers 
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_sp_mat_mul_cplx.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized intrinsic
 * C code withoutrestrictions. Note that the intrinsic C code is optimized
 * and restrictions may apply.  
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    r1, c1, c2 are multiple of 2. <BR>
 *    x1, x2 and y should be double-word aligned. <BR>
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Interruptibility : The code is interruptible. <BR>
 * @b Endian support   : supports both Little and Big endian modes. <BR>
