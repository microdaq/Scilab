/**
 *   The IIR performs an auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) filter with 4
 *   auto-regressive filter coefficients and 5 moving-average filter coefficients
 *   for nr output samples. The output vector is stored in two locations. This
 *   routine is used as a high pass filter in the VSELP vocoder. The 4 values 
 *   in the r1 vector store the initial values of the delays.
 *                                                                           
 *     @param y1[nr+4]  Delay element values (i/p and o/p).
 *     @param x[nr]     Pointer to the input array.
 *     @param y2[nr+4]  Pointer to the output array.
 *     @param hb[5]     Auto-regressive filter coefficients.
 *     @param ha[5]     Moving average filter coefficients.
 *     @param nr        Number of output samples.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_sp_iir_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized
 * linear assembly code without restrictions. Note that the linear
 * assembly code is optimized and restrictions may apply.  
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    The value of ‘nr’ must be a multiple of 2. <BR>
 *    Extraneous loads are allowed in the program. <BR>
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interruptible.
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes.
