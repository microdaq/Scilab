/**
 *   The benchmark performs a mixed radix inverse fft.
 *
 *         @param N         length of FFT in complex samples
 *         @param ptr_x     pointer to complex data input
 *         @param ptr_w     pointer to complex twiddle factor
 *         @param ptr_y     pointer to complex output data
 *         @param brev      pointer to bit reverse table containing 64 entries
 *         @param n_min     should be 4 if N can be represented as Power of 4 else, n_min should be 2
 *         @param offset    index in complex samples of sub-fft from start of main fft
 *         @param n_max     size of main fft in complex samples
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_sp_ifftSPxSP_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized linear assembly code without
 * restrictions. Note that the linear assembly code is optimized and restrictions may
 * apply.  
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     N needs to be power of 2 <BR>
 *     8 <= N <= 131072 <BR>
 *     Arrays pointed by ptr_x, ptr_w, and ptr_y should not overlap <BR>
 *     Arrays pointed by ptr_x, ptr_w, and ptr_y should align on the double words boundary <BR>
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interrupt-tolerant but not interruptible. <BR>
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>
