/**
 *      This function computes the expression “y = x1*x2” for the matrices x1 
 *      and x2. The column dimension of x1 must match the row dimension of x2. 
 *      The resulting matrix has the same number of rows as x1 and the same 
 *      number of columns as x2. The values stored in the matrices are assumed 
 *      to be single-precision floating-point values. This code is suitable for 
 *      dense matrices. No optimizations are made for sparse matrices.
 *
 *      @param  x1  = Pointer to r1 by c1 input matrix.
 *      @param  r1  = Number of rows in x1.
 *      @param  c1  = Number of columns in x1. Also number of rows in x2.
 *      @param  x2  = Pointer to c1 by c2 input matrix.
 *      @param  c2  = Number of columns in x2.
 *      @param  y   = Pointer to r1 by c2 output matrix.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSPF_sp_mat_mul.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized intrinsic
 * C code withoutrestrictions. Note that the intrinsic C code is optimized
 * and restrictions may apply.  
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *  The arrays ‘x1’, ‘x2’, and ‘y’ are stored in distinct arrays.
 *    That is, in-place processing is not allowed. <BR>
 *  All r1, c1, c2 are assumed to be > 1. <BR>
 *  5 Floats are always loaded extra from the locations: <BR>
 *    x2[c1’ * c2’], x2[c1’ * c2’ + 1],          <BR>
 *    x1[r1 * c1’], x1[r1’ * c1’] and x1[2 * c1]  <BR>
 *    where                    <BR>
 *    r1’ = r1 + (r1&1)        <BR>
 *    c2’ = c2 + (c2&1)        <BR>
 *    c1’ = c1 + 1 + 2*(c1&1)  <BR>
 *  If (r1&1) means r1 is odd, one extra row of x1[] matrix is loaded  <BR>
 *  If (c2&1) means c2 is odd, one extra col of x2[] matrix is loaded   <BR>
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Interruptibility : The code is interruptible.  <BR>
 * @b Endian support   : supports both Little and Big endian modes.  <BR>
