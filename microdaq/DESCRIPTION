Description: 
 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab can be used to develop advanced data 
 acquisitions applications. Toolbox lets you make a variety of measurements 
 directly from Scilab without the need to convert the data or import from 
 other software. Software includes functions for controlling analog inputs, 
 analog outputs, digital I/O (quadrature encoders, PWM). You can visualize 
 and analyze data, automate measurements, create wireless measurement 
 applications and a lot more with MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab.
 
 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab features automatic code generation from Xcos diagram. 
 The user can build block diagram and generate DSP application in minutes without 
 having in-depth knowledge about hardware. Generated DSP application can be 
 loaded on MicroDAQ with WiFi or Ethernet automatically. Toolbox generates 
 periodic applications with a frequency defined by the user. Depending on the 
 model complexity and used blocks, a generated application can be executed with
 up to 200kHz on MicroDAQ DSP core giving user possibility to create advanced 
 digital signal processing, control, and measurement application.
 
 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab allows easy integration of custom C/C++ code making 
 Xcos model development more flexible. The user can automatically generate Xcos 
 blocks which executes custom C/C++ code. The user can optimize some parts of 
 Xcos model by replacing standard Xcos block with a custom block which contains 
 optimized C code for faster execution.

 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab provides tools for target execution profiling. 
 This tool gives a clear answer about model execution times which in a real-time 
 application is very crucial. 
 
 Release notes:

 Major changes: 
 - Scilab 5.5.2 and Scilab 6.0.2 full support with code generation
 - No need to install SYS/BIOS and XDCTools - only DSP compiler required
 - Firmware 2.2 is required

 Data acqisition and signal generation:
  - Additional object-like API for AI/AO (mdaqAITask, mdaqAOTask)
  - Triggers for start acquisition or signal generation added
   - Start data acquisition or signal generation when DIO state is present
   - Start data acquisition or signal generation when one or more 
     DIO states are present - DIO pattern
   - Start data acquisition or signal generation when quadrature/edge counter 
     is lower/greater then value
   - Start data acquisition or signal generation when when DSP application 
     is started - AI/AO synchronization with DSP 
	 
  - mdaqAIScanTrigger, mdaqAOScanTrigger added
  - mdaqAIScanRead, mdaqAIScanStart added
  - mdaqAOScanIsDone, mdaqAOScanWait allows to check if signal generation 
    is comleted or wait until is comleted (mdaqAOScanWait)
  - mdaqAIScanInit and mdaqAOScanInit() returns an object 
  - mdaqAIScanInit and mdaqAOScanInit() can be called with object 
    instead of multiple arguments
  - data acquisition object contains custom channel name
  - mdaqEncoderInit supports additional modes (dir count, up count, down count)
  - mdaqDIOWrite, mdaqDIORead accepts vector of digital values
 
 DSP managment: 
  - mdaqDSPInit added - loads and configures DSP executable with duration 
    and rate arguments
  - mdaqDSPIsDone, mdaqDSPWait allows to check if signal generation is comleted 
    or wait until is comleted (mdaqAOScanWait)
  - Additional object-like API for DSP managment (mdaqDSPTask)

 Xcos improvements:
  - optimized SIGNAL block allows read DSP data with higher rates
  - duration and rate printed when model is loaded on DSP 

 Xcos blocks: 
  - MEM read block can load CSV file 
  - Profiler block added - allows to measure execution time of the model live
  - Encoder block supports additional modes (dir count, up count, down count)

 Other:
  - mdaqDSPSignalRead is obsolete use mdaqDSPRead instead
  - PWM ZVSFB example
