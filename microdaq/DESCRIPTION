Description: MicroDAQ toolbox conbines Scilab/XCos environment with Embedded Solutions
 MicroDAQ real-time control measurement system equpted with TI C6000 DSP. Module
 extends Scilab by allowing user to automatically generate DSP applications
 directly from XCos scheme. User can use custom XCos blocks which gives access to
 MicroDAQ hardware (ADC, DAC, DIO, PWM, UART, Quadrature Encoder). Generated DSP
 application utilizes SYS/BIOS real-time opearting system combined with code
 generated from XCos scheme.
 Depending on configuration, DSP application can be generated as a standalone or
 Ext application (similar like External Mode in Matlab/Simulink). In standalone
 mode generated application contains only real-time task, while in Ext mode code
 contains real-time task and low priority task which exchanges data with Scilab
 via TCP/IP protocol. Starting and stoping DSP application is integrated with
 standard Xcos Start/Stop buttons, module allows using standard sinks blocks to
 view live data from application running on DSP processor. Module allows to plot
 DSP execution profiles and generate DSP applications in „release” and „debug”
 mode. Generated DSP application can be used with Scilab script. Module provides
 macros for loading DSP application, reading data from running application on
 MicroDAQ device and terminating DSP execution. Attached example shows how to use
 generated DSP application to compute FFT from data acquired from ADC input.
 MicroDAQ module simplifies development of real-time control measurements
 applications, together with MicroDAQ hardware platform gives „out of the box”
 exeperience and can be an alternative to expensive commercial systems.
 
 Toolbox allows to generate DSP code directly from Xcos scheme. In order to
 compile generated C code user needs to install Texas Instruments Code Composer
 Studio 5.5 (free license with xds100 emulator). After Code Composer installation
 Scilab MicroDAQ toolbox needs to be configured with microdaq_setup function.
 Wizard will configure Scilab MicroDAQ toolbox to work with DSP compiler.
