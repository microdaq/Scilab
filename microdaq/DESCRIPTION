Description: MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab can be used to develop advanced data 
 acquisitions applications. Toolbox lets you make a variety of measurements 
 directly from Scilab without the need to convert the data or import from 
 other software. Software includes functions for controlling analog inputs, 
 analog outputs, digital I/O (quadrature encoders, PWM). You can visualize 
 and analyze data, automate measurements, create wireless measurement 
 applications and a lot more with MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab.
 
 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab features automatic code generation from Xcos diagram. 
 The user can build block diagram and generate DSP application in minutes without 
 having in-depth knowledge about hardware. Generated DSP application can be 
 loaded on MicroDAQ with WiFi or Ethernet automatically. Toolbox generates 
 periodic applications with a frequency defined by the user. Depending on the 
 model complexity and used blocks, a generated application can be executed with
 up to 200kHz on MicroDAQ DSP core giving user possibility to create advanced 
 digital signal processing, control, and measurement application.
 
 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab allows easy integration of custom C/C++ code making 
 Xcos model development more flexible. The user can automatically generate Xcos 
 blocks which executes custom C/C++ code. The user can optimize some parts of 
 Xcos model by replacing standard Xcos block with a custom block which contains 
 optimized C code for faster execution.

 MicroDAQ toolbox for Scilab provides tools for target execution profiling. 
 This tool gives a clear answer about model execution times which in a real-time 
 application is very crucial.
